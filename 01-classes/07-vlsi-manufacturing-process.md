# Class 07 - VLSI: Manufacturing Process

* **Basic Process**
    * Expose the silicon wafer to oxygen in a high temperature oven
    * The oxide SiO<sub>2</sub> is formed at the surface
    * Paint the wafer with a "resist" (organic material layer)
    * Dry the "resist" in the oven
    * Emit ultraviolet light or x-ray through masks, breaking the structure of the exposed resist molecules at the middle exposed portion
    * Use solvent to remove exposed fragile resists
    * Use hydrofluoric acid to dissolve the oxide without interfering in the resist
    * Finally, eliminate the resist with strong solvents or acids
    * Then, we get an oxide (green layer) with a gap in the middle, where the polysillicon will fit
